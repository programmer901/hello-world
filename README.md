# hello-world
Website sample
Hello,
I'm just learning how to make a website here at GitHub. I learn it because I'd like to make an own website where I can share my inventions and designs with the world. I hope I can evolve in programming. I wanna try hogy to show and share things, how to represent myself and so on.
Have a nice trip on my website!
